## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I've learned a soft skill today. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish this project in one day. But still I set this goal.  
  
This project had my full focus and priority for today. And here it are. Done in one day.

### Continued development

I need to make a better use of the modules feature we have for JavaScript. It can become my code a lot more clean and readable.
